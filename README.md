My old portfolio (v3) code
https://github.com/clleung/portfolio-v3/tree/main 

HTML is for semantic structure => CSS is to stylize

react - tags + classes are *separate*
=> html should always be a readable structure (accessibility-wise)
doesnt matter how fancy it is -> if the user cant experience it => not an experience
